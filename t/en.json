    "main1": "Amarena Pictures is a production and direction company.",
    "main2": "It was born in 2011, distinguishing itself for its adaptivity and its ability to work quickly while maintaining effectiveness and high quality. We create different genre advertising films such as branded content, VR, or even videogames that have been broadcasted on TV, web, social media and internal or corporate communication channels. It is our pride to meet our clients and advertising agencies needs.",

This derives precisely from our love for what is ‘human’: even when we film Bulgari rings or an Alfa Romeo we still give a human touch in the moving images style: today the product itself is not more important than the desire, the history, and the choice of the consumer.\"</i>",
